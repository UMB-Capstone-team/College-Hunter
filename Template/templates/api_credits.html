        <h2>College Scorecard API</h2>
        <p>
            The college search functionality on this website is powered by the College Scorecard API, provided by the U.S. Department of Education. The College Scorecard is designed to help students, parents, and advisers make informed decisions about college choices by providing access to comprehensive, reliable, and user-friendly data on cost, graduation, debt, and post-college earnings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The College Scorecard API allows developers to access and use the data provided by the U.S. Department of Education for their applications and websites. We thank the U.S. Department of Education for providing this valuable resource to the public.
